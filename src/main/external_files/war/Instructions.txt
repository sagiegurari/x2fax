The Web2Fax.war enables to expose faxing capabilities on top of HTTP web servers.

This default parser expects a multi part HTTP request as follows:
    -file [file content]
    -filename [file name without path]
    -priority [priority value as defined in the enum]
    -targetaddress [target address]
    -targetname [target name]
    -sendername [sender name]
    -senderfaxnumber [sender fax number]
    -senderemail [sender email]

This may change in case the HTTP request parser was changed via fax4j configuration.
