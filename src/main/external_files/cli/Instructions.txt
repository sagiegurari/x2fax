The SendFax utility enables to send fax based on input parameters.

The default command line arguments the CLI expects are as follows:
    -file [full file name]
    -priority [priority value as defined in the enum]
    -target_address [target address]
    -target_name [target name]
    -sender_name [sender name]
    -sender_fax_number [sender fax number]
    -sender_email [sender email]
    -property:[property name] [property value] 

This may change in case the command line arguments parser was changed via fax4j configuration.
